# Spotify-Azure-Project
This  end-to-end Azure data engineering project designed by building a Spotify data pipeline. Uses medallion architecture where data moves from a cloud-hosted SQL database into bronze, silver, and gold layers within a Data Lake. The project emphasizes industry-standard practices, including CI/CD integration with GitHub, dynamic parameterized pipelines, and incremental data loading using Azure Data Factory. Advanced processing is handled through Azure Databricks, featuring Unity Catalog for governance and Delta Live Tables for managing slowly changing dimensions. Additionally, the project covers monitoring via Logic Apps and automated deployment using Databricks Asset Bundles
